# First-Class Functions
# All functions in Python are first-class functions

# First-Class Objects
# can be passed to a function as an argument
# can be returned from a function
# can be assigned to a variable
# can be stored in a data structure (such as list, tuple, dictionary, etc.)

# Types such as int, float, string, tuple, list and many more are first-class objects.
# Functions (function) are also first-class objects


# Higher-Order Functions
# take a function as an argument
# and/or
# return a function
